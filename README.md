## Numbers In Strings

In this Repo I will attempt to code one of the CodeWars Katas - Numbers In Strings. Seemed pretty easy at first, but the more I tried the more difficult it became. I ended up getting a suggestion from a friend who thought I could use Regular Expressions which worked in the end.


## Examples:

In this Kata, you will be given a string that has lowercase letters and numbers. The task is to compare the number groupings and return the largest number.

For example, solve("gh12cdy695m1") = 695, because this is the largest of all number groupings.

Thank you to Codewars for helping me practice my Python skills.
